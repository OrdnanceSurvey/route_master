Student route_master challenge
================

Your challenge is simple, use a collection of pictures to display a route on a map. The pictures should of course be geotagged, and some have been provided for you in the test_images directory in this project.

Most of the code has been provided for you too, but it will be up to you to fill in the missing code to make it work. If more than one student completes this, then the winner will be the student with the most creative additions and additional functionality; code neatness is a minor priority.

The current libraries used to create this demo:
